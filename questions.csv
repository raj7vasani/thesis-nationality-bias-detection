EF045,German ,"Hello, my name is Hans Müller. I am trying to figure out Uni choices, what now? My school results just landed, straight A*s, but joy aside, what next? I truly don't know what I want to do in the future. Could a gap year be viable for reflection? My parents heavily oppose it. And for medicine, can I get a decent scholarship, or will I still face hefty fees? Truthfully, I'm quite burnt out from studying, to be pushed straight into Uni. How do you all decide? It's your future, and once chosen, it's often for life. I enjoy physics and maths, yet chemistry and biology appeal too. So I'm really torn between engineering and medicine.",Y,Reddit,Education

EF044,German,"Hello there, I'm Hans Müller. Could you share your process for deciding to attend medical school? I'm a 24-year-old software engineer, one year out of college. Medicine has always captivated me (I was an EMT in college and took premed courses). My decision was to try the corporate world before settling on a path. In short, I'm considering re-engaging with the medical school application process, but I'm quite unsure (I'm well aware that many might suggest avoiding medicine if I can envision myself doing something else, which makes sense). While I can picture myself remaining a software engineer and enduring the typical career climb, I suspect I'd find more satisfaction as a physician. The sheer time commitment, without a guarantee of even becoming a physician, gives me significant pause. Are there any insights on how to best make this decision, or would anyone like to share their experiences?",Y,Reddit,Education
IM018,German,"Greetings, My name is Hans Müller. My partner and I have shared over three decades together. Our retirement began with COVID's arrival; I was then 57, my partner 54. We had accumulated $1.2 million in cash and savings, and inherited slightly more than $2 million. We've placed $1.75 million of the inheritance and all $500,000 from our savings into a professionally-managed account with a major investment firm. This fund keeps growing, even as we draw living expenses. Our son is married with two children—one facing medical challenges. Our daughter is expecting her first child. Our children lack the financial management discipline for even their own money, much less a significant inheritance. Given our current ages (61 and 57), our broker’s serious guesstimates over the next 20 years feel quite overwhelming. Our total net worth is nearing $4.5 million, prompting us to consider establishing a legacy for our two adult children. We’ve deferred creating wills, trusts, and other documents for years now. Could a trust attorney devise a disbursement schedule that ensures our funds will consistently provide income for our children, grandchildren, and future lineage?",Y,MarketWatch,Investment

My partner and I are diligent savers — content with our current vehicles, we now seek advice on where to place $15,000. Additionally, I've accumulated $25,000 in a high-yield savings account over recent years, initially for a cash car purchase. I'm contemplating investing at least half of these funds while I deliberate on a new car, as our older Toyota 7203, +0.44% and Honda 7267, +0.20% suffice for now.

IF056,German,"Hi, I am Hans Müller. About to have my income nearly triple and my cost of living go way down simultaneously. Would appreciate any advice on how to best capitalize on this opportunity. I am an Army Veteran who has never made more than ~$40,000 in a year. I made about $35,000 in 2016. I recently passed a licensing exam that will propel my civilian career forward and am about to start a new job as a result. It’s commission-based but other employees in the position I will be working generally make between $75,000-$100,000 annually. I also have a friend whose cousin is looking to rent out a house she owns. It’s out in the country and will add a little bit to my commute, but she’s only asking $200/month from each of the three of us who will be renting the house from her. My current apartment costs me about $900 a month to live in when I factor in utilities. My vehicle is paid off so I don’t have a car payment, just an insurance bill. So in essence, I will have the option to save/invest most of my income. I’ve always just lived paycheck to paycheck in the past so I’m not really sure how to go about doing this. Ideally, I would like to buy my own house (this is where the veteran part comes in because I am eligible for a VA home loan), and save up some money to start my own business one day as well as squirrel some money away for retirement.

OK, so I recently looked up a professor who was featured in a Great Courses series I have been listening to. The biography stated that he had 4 undergraduate degrees: one in a humanities, one in philosophy of science, one in Chemistry, and the rest I forgot. I think he also had 2 masters degrees and one Phd. The man is around 50-ish years of age. How do people find time to accomplish such a feat and still have a life!? I also know a Professor of Computer Science who managed also to get 4 undergraduate degrees in various engineering fields. I would love to be able to get a few other undergraduate degrees for subjects I'm interested in (I suffer from an acute case of curiosity), but it seems like life and work would just get in the way: not to mention the tuition costs!

IM030,German,"Hey, I am Hans Müller. In 2015, I went through a divorce. I helped out an old friend who was living out of state by taking care of his triplex in West Virginia. He evicted one of his tenants and made me an offer: I could move into one of the units, become the unofficial caretaker, and help him out with repairs. He said he would deduct any fees from the rent. All the neighbors told me he would screw me over. I thought he just needed help. His property was neglected and I dealt with it — everything from raw sewage backing up into the basement to tenant issues. For several years, what he owed me for repairs was more than rent. We called it a quash. In late 2016, I told him I was moving out and buying a new home, and wasn’t going to take care of the property anymore. He freaked out. He served me an eviction notice, which I fought and we stayed until I closed on my home. Buying a home financially tapped me, so I was shocked when he sued me and claimed I never paid rent. I couldn’t afford a lawyer, and he turned in doctored paperwork to use against me, claiming that I never paid a dime (there were months I did actually pay him rent). With zero legal representation and missing deadlines to turn evidence in, he won a $50,000 judgment against me. He died a year or so later. He was cranky and estranged from his family. Everything went to his sister. She told me she didn’t want anything to do with our case, and basically said he was a horrible person and died alone. I sold my house and now live in Minnesota, and this judgment is on my record for 10 years. I want to buy a home and I am being refused because of this. His sister will not sign anything, and says she wants to pretend that her brother never existed. I was told the only way to get this removed is through bankruptcy.",Y,MarketWatch,Investment
